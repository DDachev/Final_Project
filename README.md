# Register for Libraries

The project is an application that provides the ability to create a database. Libraries can be created in this database to add books and visitors to. The registry provides the ability to search by many different criteria.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install before deploy a project:

IntelliJ IDEA or STS (preferred) or Eclipse...
Apache Maven
MySql
NodeJs
Angular CLI
Visual Studio Code

### Setup

1. After downloading the ".zip" file from GitHub,you have to unzip the file into a folder (workspace of your IDE).
2. Open folder named Back-End/LibraryProject from your IDE. 
3. After the project is loaded into your IDE, you have to open file with name application.properties (path - src/main/resources) and type your username and password on database. After that you have to start the project with the command "Run as Spring Application". If this has been compiled, then the base will be installed (we have to install MySQL before that).
4. Open unzipped folder - "Front End" and copy the path to it.
5. Open Command Prompt(cmd) and type cd command and paste the path (from point 4) and start it.
6. After that type the npm install command (in cmd), which installs all the node modules.
7. After everything is installed, you have to enter the npm start command (in cmd) to compile the application.
8. If compiled successfully, the application can be accessed in the web browser at the address localhost:4200.
